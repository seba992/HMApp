How to use LaTeX:
Move into project directory (included .tex file) and next:
a) latex name.tex - make .dvi file - it gives you preview while editing.
b) pdflatex nazwa.tex - make .pdf file - you need to close .pdf file before invoke function.
I think it is obvious that you should have already installed LaTeX.
